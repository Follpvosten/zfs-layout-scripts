# zfs-layout-scripts
Some scripts to set up zfs datasets for different operating systems.  
Also scripts to generate fitting fstab files for them.  
They are meant to be used by me - read the scripts before using them and then
decide if they are fit for your purpose and modify them in case you need to.
